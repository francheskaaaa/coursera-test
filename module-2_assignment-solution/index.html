   		To date, folklore is Swift's most critically acclaimed album. It has a solid grade of 88 on Metacritic and nearly universal praise from reviewers. It also sold a million copies in three months: the only album in 2020 to do so in the United States. On top of that, it took home a golden gramaphone for Album of the Year at this year's Grammy Awards.

  		Red was an important album in Taylor Swift's career. It marked the beginning of her crossover from country music into mainstream pop music, and has a pretty impressive tracklist to boot. Some of those tracks include "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together," "22," "Red," and "I Knew You Were Trouble."

  		1989 was Swift's dazzling entrance into the pop world. It also cemented her status as a musical juggernaut, as it was the only album of 2014 to sell over a million copies in its first week of sales. Unlike Red, 1989 was awarded the Grammy for Album of the Year, thus proving all Swift needed was a change in sound to win. The win made her the first woman to win the award twice, as well as the first person to win the award for both pop and country albums.
